    PROS: Membership is not required for main features. You can set your side to
    one temperature and your partner can set to a different temperature. This
    cover goes over your existing mattress and is not noticeable (older versions
    may have been uncomfortable). You can set a schedule for temperature
    controls per day per side. You can manually override the schedule to set the
    temperature at any time. You can set vibration wake-up alarms per side with
    adjustable strength (Although light sleepers can still hear or feel the
    vibration from the other side). The accuracy is questionable but the app
    will try to wake you up in your desired timeframe, while maintaining REM
    sleep.
  </p>
  <p>
    CONS: Membership only required for heart rate tracking and other features
    (which is likely not accurate anyway). The device is noisy when starting up
    but is relatively quiet during the night in normal operation.

    This cover uses water so some precaution maybe needed with pets. Much
    cheaper alternative products use air instead. There may be some alternatives
    available that also use water, with varying comfort.
