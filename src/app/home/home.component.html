<p>If there is an annual fee, cancel your account before the year ends. Most banks will let you get the signup bonus again after 2 years. </p>

<h2>Review sites</h2>
<p>
    Here are the websites I check. Be wary of review sites with nothing but amazon links, reviewed by someone who never actually used any of the products.

        <p>They have a 5 article limit but you can easily get around by using  incognito mode, clear your cache/cookies, open another browser profile (available in <a target="_blank" href="https://brave.com/">Brave browser</a>), or using another browser.</p>
        <p>They have a history of corruption so take the higher-end ($1000+) suggestions with a grain of salt.</p>
