    <p>If you're not confident with your credit score, read more at <a target="_blank" href="https://www.doctorofcredit.com/questions-to-ask-yourself-before-applying-for-that-next-credit-card/">should you apply?</a> to see if "churning" is right for you. You may wish to avoid the credit card bonuses and only stick to the bank account bonuses. Bonus/interest over $10 is reported to the IRS. The banks will usually both mail the relevant tax form to your address and provide it in your account settings online. 
    </p>

<p>If there is an annual fee, cancel your account before the year ends. Most banks will let you get the signup bonus again after 2 years. </p>

<h2>Review sites</h2>
<p>
    Be wary of the review sites from your top google search with nothing but top 5 or top 10 amazon links. Those low quality sites are often reviewed by someone who has no hands on experience with any of the products.
</p>
<p>Here are a few quality review websites with hands-on experience:</p>
<ul>
    <li>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.techgearlab.com/">TechGearLab</a></p>

    <p>These websites below loosely enforce article limits, but you can easily work around it by using  incognito mode, clear your cache/cookies, open another browser profile (available in <a target="_blank" href="https://brave.com/">Brave browser</a>), or using another browser.
    <li>
        <p><a target="_blank" href="https://www.rtings.com/">RTINGS</a> for electronics</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <a target="_blank" href="https://www.wirecutter.com/">NY Times - Wirecutter</a>
        <p> You can also check out their <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/deals/#deals-controls">deals page</a>.
        <p>They have a history of pay-to-play corruption so take the higher-end ($1000+) suggestions with a grain of salt.</p>
