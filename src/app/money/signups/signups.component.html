  to see if "churning" is right for you. You may wish to avoid the credit card
  bonuses and only stick to the bank account bonuses. Bonus/interest over $10 is
  reported to the IRS. The banks will usually both mail the relevant tax form to
  your address and provide it in your account settings online.

<p>
  Most banks such as Chase have no early cancellation fee and will let you get
  the signup bonus again after 2 years. There may be annual or monthly fees, so
  cancel your account after the bonus posts. Then, move your money to the next
  bonus (and check DoctorOfCredit for info on fees) or just park your savings in
  Juno (<a href="#juno-onlinebank">listed below</a>).
